# Web3 Features

dAppling aims to create a web hosting service specifically geared toward Web3 protocols. This means we've developed (and are developing) lots of fun Web3-specific features.

1. [Verify Site CIDs](../getting-started/verify-a-site-cid.md)
   * A common Web3 hack is cloning known, trusted websites to access users' private information. dAppling allows users to sign their deployed sites CID using a Web3 wallet to verify the veracity of the site. This can increase your users trust and willingness to engage with your site.
2. Verify smart contracts
   * dAppling created a [tool](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeiblph2j2n55xajfe4eqtdpckzzvtdwbyhz4yv6eihqedy24qljq5u/) to lookup verified smart contracts on ENS. This can make it easier for users to find, access, and increase their trust in your smart contracts.
3. ENS Support
   *   Link your website with your [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://docs.ens.domains/) domain to allow users to access your project without DNS. dAppling also assigns each project a dappling.eth subdomain for added flexibility in your domains.
