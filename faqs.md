# ‚ùì FAQs

The [Getting Started](getting-started/) section and [Key Concepts](learn/) answers many common questions. If you have questions that are not answered send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dApplingNetwork). We answer all DMs.&#x20;

### My site deployed successfully, but when I try to access the deployment URL, I get a 504 error.&#x20;

This can happen for a variety of reasons, including the IPFS node pinning your CID being down or out of service, issues with the IPFS gateway, or a high network latency between the you and the node. This does not mean that your content is lost or inaccessible! One potential solution is to use a different [gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-providers). Select a gateway from this [list](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) and append it to your url.&#x20;

For example, if the url that is timing out is: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{CID}, with Cloudflare, your new url would be: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/{CID}/

### What does deploying a site through dAppling cost?

dAppling should be free for most lower traffic use-cases (hackathon projects, portfolio sites, open source apps). Full pricing can be seen at dappling.network

### If decentralized deployments are so great, why does dAppling still use centralized infrastructure?

dAppling fully believes in the future and power of decentralized web hosting. However, the current state of web hosting necessitates our use of centralized services. Decentralized infrastructure is constantly growing, and with the development and growth of dAppling, we hope to further that growth. Once web hosting can subsist entirely on a decentralized infrastructure, dAppling will make that switch.

### I have a question/issue/feedback.

We love questions/feedback! _(not so much issues - although we do love improving our services)_&#x20;

DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dApplingNetwork). Our goal is to bring you an amazing, easy-to-use product so please let us know if you need help, have a suggestion, or would like to chat :smile:&#x20;

### I don't see the chatbot and I have a problem!

Some plugins, extensions, and browsers interfere with Intercom and its chatbot. If it doesn't render, try using a private/incognito window, a different browser, or turn off extensions. If it still doesn't load, dm us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dApplingNetwork).&#x20;



:cactus:_Fun Fact: There are very few black flowers in nature. Most of them are actually very deep shades of purple or red. The Black Dahlia is one of the darkest flowers that exist, although even it is not truly black._
