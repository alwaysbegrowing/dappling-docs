# Environment Variables

Environment Variables are key-value pairs configured outside your source code.

Your source code can read these values to change behavior during the Build Step.

All values visible to any user that has access to the [Project](./). It is only safe to use public environment variables.

Changes to Environment Variables are not applied to previous deployments, they only apply to new deployments.

## Declare an Environment Variable

To declare an Environment Variable for your deployment, go to the Environment Variables section of your Project Settings.
