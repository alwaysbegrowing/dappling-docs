# Project Dashboard

Each dAppling project has its dedicated dashboard for configuring settings, viewing deployments, and more.

Here's a high-level overview of the dashboard's functionality, with links to more detailed resources.

## Project Details

The Project Overview tab provides an overview of your production deployment, including its deployments, domains, status, and more.

## Deployments

The project dashboard allows you to manage all your current and previous deployments associated with your project. To handle a deployment, select the project in the dashboard and click on the Deployments tab in the top navigation.

## Domains

Each project has the ability for custom DNS or ENS domains.&#x20;

Lean more in [our Domains docs.](../domains.md)

## Analytics

Each project has the option to have privacy preserving analytics that collects page views and referral sources.&#x20;

## Settings

The Settings tab enables you to configure your project. You can modify the project's name, specify its root directory, configure environment variables, and more directly within the dashboard.
