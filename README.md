# ðŸŒ± Introduction

Welcome.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide quick and efficient decentralized web hosting to serve the needs of Web3 protocols. With blockchain technology, decentralized backends have become commonplace, however decentralized frontends are still in their nascency. dAppling is harnessing the power of centralized services with the innovation of [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) to provide a simple and easy-to-use hosting service.&#x20;
