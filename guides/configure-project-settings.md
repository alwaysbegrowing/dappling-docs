The “Settings” tab on the project has the configuration that is used upon every deployment.

There is the **build commands** that modify the way your project is built. If something doesn’t seem right on your app’s output on the site, you may have to modify these settings.

The git repository and **“production” branch** is where we download the source code. Make sure your code is pushed and up to date here!

Careful about the **delete project** button it’ll make your project disappear.
