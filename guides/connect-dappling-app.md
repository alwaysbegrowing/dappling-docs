# Connect dAppling App

dAppling uses a custom Github application to access and deploy users' projects. While logging in to our application allows you to connect your Github account to dAppling, for deployments, dAppling must have access to your Github repositories. Therefore, to deploy a site through dAppling, you must first give the dAppling app access to the repository you wish to deploy.



1.  Navigate to [dappling.network](https://dappling.network) and select "Log in & Deploy"
