# Deployments

A dAppling Deployment is the result of a successful build of your Project.

When you create a deployment, dAppling automatically generates a new and unique URL. You can visit this URL to preview your changes in a live environment.

\
You can deploy your projects to dAppling using [Github](git-integrations/dappling-for-github.md).&#x20;

## Git

The most common way to create a Deployment on dAppling is through pushing code to [Git](git-integrations/dappling-for-github.md)[ ](git-integrations/)repositories.

Creating an automatic Deployment starts by[ importing a Git repository on dAppling](git-integrations/). This repository can be either private or public. To set up a Git repository, click the [New Project](https://dappling.network/new) button from the dAppling dashboard.

Deploying your application using dAppling's Git integration provides you with the following benefits:

* Streamlined collaboration through pull requests or merge requests.
* The ability to test new features and changes using Preview Deployments before merging them into the main branch to automatically create a Production Deployment.
