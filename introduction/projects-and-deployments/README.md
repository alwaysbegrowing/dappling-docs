# Projects and Deployments

To get started with dAppling, it's good to know about projects and deployments:

* [Projects](../../projects/): A project represents the application you've deployed with dAppling. You can have several projects associated with a single repository and multiple deployments for each project. Access all your projects from the dashboard and configure their settings via the project dashboard.
* [Deployments](../../deployments/): A deployment is the outcome of a successful build for your project. It's initiated when you import an existing project or when you push a Git commit to GitHub. Each deployment automatically generates a unique URL.
