# Import an existing project

Your existing project can be any web project that generates static HTML content, like a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you choose one of our [supported frameworks](../../legacy-docs/getting-started/frameworks.md), we'll automatically detect and configure the best build and deployment settings for your chosen framework.

## 1. Connect your Git provider

On the [New Project](https://dappling.network/new) page, click on the Connect Repo button.

Follow the prompts to sign in to your [GitHub](../../deployments/git-integrations/dappling-for-github.md)

## 2. Import your repository

Find the repository in the list that you would like to import and click Select.

## 3. Optionally, configure any settings

dAppling will automatically detect the framework and any required build settings. You can also configure the project settings at this stage, which includes [build and output settings](../../builds/configure-a-build.md) as well as [environment variables](../../projects/environment-variables.md). You can also set these configurations at a later time.

* To update the framework, build command, install command, or output directory edit as needed.
* To set environment variables, expand the Environment Variables section and either paste or copy them in. (coming soon)

## 4. Deploy your project

Click the Deploy button, and dAppling will create the Project and initiate the deployment process according to your selected configurations.

## 5. Share Project

To access your deployment, navigate to the dashboard, choose the Project, and then select the Production Domain. The page is now accessible to anyone with the URL.
