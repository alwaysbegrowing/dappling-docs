# Add a domain

Assigning a custom domain to your project ensures that visitors to your application experience a tailored, brand-aligned experience.

On dAppling, your custom domain can take any format you choose:

* `ethereum.org` (apex domain)
* `blog.ethereum.org` (subdomain)
* `*.ethereum.org` (wildcard domain)

You must already own a domain to use it with dAppling.

For more details on domains with dAppling, check out the [Domains](../domains.md) overview.
