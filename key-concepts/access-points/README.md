For protocols to develop and thrive, their content must be generally accessible. Since IPFS does not use the HTTP standard, dAppling is particularly concerned about providing easy, diverse access points for our users.&#x20;

dAppling offers two main access points:

2. [Ethereum Name Service](ethereum-name-service.md)
