# Web Hosting

### Overview

Web hosting is a fundamental aspect of the digital world. It allows individuals, companies, and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. At dAppling, we strive to make hosting a simple, easy process for Web3 devs.

### Understanding Web Hosting

Web hosting is a service provided by hosting providers that allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files. These servers store the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and media content that comprises the website. When users want to access a website, their browsers send a request to the server hosting the site, which then sends the required files back to the browser.&#x20;

dAppling uses Amazon Web Services to store and manage centralized deployments, and Interplanetary File System ([IPFS](ipfs.md)) to store and manage decentralized deployments. This dual-hosting approach ensures&#x20;

### Importance of Web Hosting

The digital age has emphasized the importance of having an online presence. Web hosting services are crucial for maintaining an online presence and making the site accessible to users around the globe.&#x20;

#### Decentralization

With the growth of blockchain technology such as custom blockchains and smart contracts, decentralized backends have become more accessible than ever. However, Web3 frontends rely heavily on centralized web hosting services, meaning services that are provided by a central organization such as Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare. As a protocol's frontend is integral to its presence, development, and community, the lack of decentralized hosting services is a major barrier to full decentralization.

### Benefits of Web Hosting

#### Accessibility and Uptime

One of the primary benefits of web hosting is the ability to make a website accessible 24/7. At dAppling, with our use of both centralized and decentralized hosting infrastructure, we can guarantee a high uptime, meaning your website will remain accessible without interruptions 99% of the time. Even if centralized services go down, the nature of decentralization ensures your website remains accessible.

#### Scalability

As your business or website grows, your web hosting services can grow with it. The nature of decentralization allows for easy scalability - as more nodes are added, websites can be served faster and more efficiently.
