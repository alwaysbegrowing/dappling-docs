# Access Points

### Overview

For protocols to develop and thrive, their content must be generally accessible. Since IPFS does not use the HTTP standard, dAppling is particularly concerned about providing easy access points for our users.&#x20;

### Domain Management

Domain management is one method of creating an access point. It involves the process of managing and maintaining domain names and their related services. dAppling offers domain management from within our UI to make domains and deployments easy and quick to manage.

#### Understanding Domain Management

Domain management refers to the administration of one or more domain names used by individuals or organizations for their websites. It includes registering new domain names, renewing existing ones, transferring domains between registrars, managing DNS settings, and more. In essence, domain management ensures that a domain name correctly leads users to the desired website and that all associated services function properly.

#### Importance of Domain Management

Domain names serve as your address on the internet. Since IPFS uses complicated CIDs to track content, creating and maintaining a domain is vital to ensuring your presence remains consistent and accessible. Poor domain management can lead to missed renewals, unintended service interruptions, or security vulnerabilities, all of which can negatively impact your online presence.

#### Key Aspects of Domain Management

**Domain Registration**

This is the process of purchasing and registering a domain name from a domain registrar. The domain name is leased for a certain period (usually one year), after which it must be renewed.

#### Domain Renewal

Domains must be renewed periodically to ensure continued ownership. Failing to renew a domain on time can result in the domain becoming available for others to purchase. Automatic renewal settings can be used to avoid accidental expiry.

#### Domain Transfers

If you decide to change your domain registrar, you'll need to initiate a domain transfer. This process can involve unlocking the domain, obtaining a transfer code, and coordinating between the old and new registrars.

#### DNS Management

DNS (Domain Name System) management involves configuring your domain to point to the right web server. This usually includes setting up A records, CNAME records, MX records for email, and potentially other DNS settings. dAppling allows users to setup CNAME records to create and manage subdomains.&#x20;

#### Domain Security

This involves implementing measures to protect your domain from potential threats. This may include enabling domain locking to prevent unauthorized transfers, implementing DNSSEC for secure DNS responses, and utilizing WHOIS privacy to protect your personal information displayed in the public WHOIS database.

### Conclusion

Accessibility is a cornerstone of developing and thriving protocols, especially when deviating from the conventional HTTP standard, such as with IPFS. This places a significant emphasis on creating easy and efficient access points for users. Within these access points, domain management is a key component, responsible for crucial tasks like domain registration, renewal, transfers, DNS management, and security. With proper domain management, we ensure that the content remains reachable and secure. dAppling remains steadfast in offering these access points, making the shift from conventional protocols to IPFS smoother and more manageable.
