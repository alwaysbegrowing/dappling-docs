# Decentralization

### Overview

Decentralization has become a pervasive and transformative principle across various sectors, redefining traditional models of organization and governance. At its core, decentralization involves the dispersion of power, authority, and decision-making processes from a central authority to multiple nodes or individuals. This paradigm shift promotes greater autonomy, resilience, and democratization in systems, whether it be in technology, finance, or even social structures. By distributing control and resources, decentralization mitigates the risks associated with single points of failure and fosters innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity. From blockchain networks and peer-to-peer systems to decentralized finance and governance models, the concept of decentralization continues to gain traction as a catalyst for a more open, transparent, and equitable future.

dAppling focuses specifically on applying decentralization to Web3 frontends. Decentralized frontend deployments are an innovative method of application distribution that involves spreading out data and web resources across multiple nodes, rather than hosting everything in one centralized location.

### Understanding Decentralized Frontend Deployments

Decentralized frontend deployments utilize decentralized networks, such as blockchain networks or peer-to-peer networks, to host and deliver web applications. Unlike traditional centralized models, where all resources are hosted and controlled by a single entity, decentralized deployments distribute resources across multiple nodes or servers.

dAppling uses [IPFS](ipfs.md) which is a peer-to-peer protocol. Simply put, individual computers join the [IPFS](ipfs.md) network and are able to serve content to anyone who requests it. You deploy your website to IPFS using dAppling's infrastructure, and anytime a user requests your website, any computer on the IPFS network can deliver your content to that user.&#x20;

### Importance of Decentralized Frontend Deployments

As Web3 grows and we become more digitally connected, the need for reliable, secure, and high-performing web applications has skyrocketed. The conventional centralized hosting model, while effective to some degree, has several shortcomings, such as single points of failure, potential for censorship, and susceptibility to DDoS attacks.

Decentralized frontend deployments address these issues by ensuring no single entity has total control over the network. This provides higher resilience against attacks and failures, greater privacy and security, and lower latency due to the proximity of resources.

### Benefits of Decentralized Frontend Deployments

#### Increased Reliability and Availability

Decentralized deployments inherently eliminate single points of failure because the application and its data are not stored on one single server, but spread across multiple nodes, or computers. Even if one node fails, others can still serve the application, providing increased availability and reliability.

#### Improved Security

In a decentralized network, the risk of a data breach is significantly reduced. An attacker would have to compromise a majority of nodes in the network to access the data, which is highly unlikely and requires much more resources than attacking a single centralized server.

#### Resistance to Censorship

Because there is no central authority that controls a decentralized network, it is virtually impossible for an entity to manipulate or censor information. This ensures a free and open web where information is democratically distributed.&#x20;

dAppling simply facilitates the decentralized deployment process and therefore does not have any control or authority over the content being deployed.

#### Trustlessness

As no single entity has total control over the network, decentralization deployments are trustless deployments. You do not need to trust dAppling to host and maintain your site. Once it is deployed on IPFS, dAppling cannot move, change, or remove your site; it will remain on IPFS in its deployed form as long as the IPFS network exists.

#### Lower Latency

In a decentralized network, data can be served from the geographically nearest node, reducing the distance that data must travel and consequently reducing latency. This can greatly improve the speed and performance of web applications, especially for users who are geographically distant from the central server in a traditional centralized model.

### Conclusion

The decentralization of frontend deployments represents an evolution of the web development landscape. By distributing resources across multiple nodes, these deployments offer enhanced reliability, improved security, trustlessness, resistance to censorship, and lower latency.

While there are still challenges to be faced in managing and scaling these systems, dAppling is taking advantage of the power of decentralization to provide a quintessentially Web3 hosting experience.
