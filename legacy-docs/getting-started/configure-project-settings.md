The “Settings” tab on the project has the configuration that is used upon every deployment.

There is the **build commands** that modify the way your project is built. If something doesn’t seem right on your app’s output on the site, you may have to modify these settings.

The **build variables** allows you to set the variables that can be accessed during the build process. They are not available during runtime and are **not encrypted. Do not store sensitive information in these variables.** Use build variables to manage your build; they allow you to do things like environment configuration, build optimization, or setting global constants.

The git repository and **“production” branch** is where we download the source code. Make sure your code is pushed and up to date here!

Careful about the **delete project** button it’ll make your project disappear.
